 ✋ Hand Gesture Recognition using CNN  

 📌 Project Overview  
This project develops a Hand Gesture Recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from **image or video data**.  
The model enables **intuitive human-computer interaction** and can be extended for **gesture-based control systems** such as:  
- Touchless interfaces  
- Smart home device control  
- AR/VR applications  
- Accessibility tools  


 ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** (Deep Learning framework)  
- **OpenCV** (Image/Video preprocessing)  
- **NumPy & Matplotlib** (Data handling & visualization)  
- **Google Colab** (Development environment)  


 📂 Dataset  
- The project uses a **public Hand Gesture Dataset** (e.g., [Kaggle Hand Gesture Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog) or any custom dataset).  
- Dataset contains multiple gesture classes such as **fist, palm, thumbs up, thumbs down, stop, okay, etc.**  


🧠 Model Architecture  
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with:  
  - Convolutional layers for feature extraction  
  - MaxPooling layers for dimensionality reduction  
  - Dense layers with ReLU activation  
  - Softmax output layer for classification
